## 🔐 Privacy & Encryption Commitment  

### **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**  
Private **one-on-one text messages and voice notes** are **end-to-end encrypted** using **AES-256-GCM + ECDH**. This means:  

✅ **No one—including me as the developer—can access your private chats or private voice notes.**  
✅ **Text messages sent in private chats (between two users) and voice notes sent in private chats (between two users) are encrypted at the sender’s device and only decrypted on the recipient’s device.**  
✅ **Even if I access the database directly, I cannot read or retrieve private messages or private voice notes in plain text/data**  

For **full transparency**, here’s a snapshot of how private messages and private voice notes are stored in the database—fully encrypted and unreadable to anyone, including myself.  

### This is how your private chat text messages that are e2ee looks like in database
![](next-js-frontend/public/images/privacy/e2ee-messages-in-database.png)

### This is how your private chat voice notes that are also e2ee looks like

##### Here each file in this folder `encrypted-audio` represents a single e2ee voice note

##### And this is how your encrypted voice note data looks like
![](next-js-frontend/public/images/privacy/encrypted-voice-note-data.png)

### **What’s Not E2EE?**  
While all data is stored securely, end-to-end encryption is **only applied to private text messages and private voice notes**. The following are **not** end-to-end encrypted:  

❌ **Group chats**  
❌ **Audio & video calls (powered by webrtc)**  
❌ **Media files (images, videos, GIFs, documents, attachments, etc.)**  

These features are still securely transmitted and stored, but they do not follow the same encryption standard as private messages and private voice notes.  

At **Mernchat**, i am committed to transparency and security. As i continue improving, my aim is to enhance encryption features for even greater privacy in future updates.

## **🚀 Getting Started**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr-oxi-ma/mern-chat-app
cd mern-chat-app
```

### **2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables**  

#### **Backend Configuration**  
1. Navigate to the **backend** folder.  
2. Rename `.env.development.example` to `.env.development`.  
3. Rename `.env.production.example` to `.env.production`.  
4. Replace the placeholder values with actual credentials.  
5. Create a `firebase-admin-cred.json` file inside `backend/src/` (root level of `src`). This file should contain your Firebase service account credentials required for Firebase push notifications.
6. 📝 **Example `backend/src/firebase-admin-cred.json` file**, Paste your own cred here provided by firebase  
```json
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "your-client-email",
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "your-client-x509-cert-url",
    "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```
---

#### **Frontend Configuration**  
1. Navigate to the **frontend** folder.  
2. Rename `.env.development.example` to `.env.development`.  
3. Rename `.env.production.example` to `.env.production`.  
4. Replace the placeholder values with actual credentials.  

🚨 **Important Notes:**  
- Never expose sensitive credentials to client side by prefixing them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.  
- Ensure the correct Firebase cred and API URLs are set.  
---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies & Run the Application**  

#### **Start the Backend First**  
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The backend will start at **http://localhost:8000**.  

---

#### **Then Start the Frontend**  
```bash
cd next-js-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

---
### **4️⃣ Database Setup & Migrations**  

#### **Available Database Commands**  
These scripts are defined in `package.json` under the **next-js-frontend** folder:  

```json
{
  "db:push:dev": "dotenv -e .env.development -- npx prisma db push",
  "db:push:prod": "dotenv -e .env.production -- npx prisma db push",
  "migrate:dev": "dotenv -e .env.development -- npx prisma migrate deploy",
  "migrate:prod": "dotenv -e .env.production -- npx prisma migrate deploy"
}
```

#### **Push the Schema (Non-Migratory Approach)**  
If you just need to sync the database schema without migrations:  
- **Development:**  
  ```bash
  npm run db:push:dev
  ```
- **Production:**  
  ```bash
  npm run db:push:prod
  ```

#### **Run Migrations (For Versioned Changes)**  
If you are making structural changes and need to apply existing migrations:  
- **Development:**  
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:dev
  ```
- **Production:**  
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:prod
  ```

🚀 **Note:**  
- `db push` is useful when setting up the database initially or for quick schema changes **without** migration tracking.  
- `migrate deploy` ensures **existing** migrations are applied in production and development.
